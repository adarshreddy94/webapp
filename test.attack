Feature: To scan the open ports
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name            | value |
      | hostname        | 10.0.2.15   |
      | tcp_ping_ports  | 22,80,443     |
  Scenario: Verify expected ports are open
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p 22 10.0.2.15
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      22/tcp\s+open
      """
    And the following profile:
      | tcp_ports       | 22    |
    Scenario: Verify whether it works
      When I launch an "generic" attack with:

        """
        ping -c 1 10.0.2.15
        """
      Then the output should match:
        """
        successfull communication
        """
  Scenario: Verify port is open
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p 80 10.0.2.15
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      80/tcp\s+open
      """
     And the following profile:
       Scenario Outline: Perform few attacks on it
         When I launch a "curl" attack with:
           """
           curl -i -X GET 10.0.2.15
           """
         Then the output should contain "<response>"
         Examples:
           | method  | response      |
           | delete  | Error 405 (Method Not Allowed)        |
           | patch   | Error 405 (Method Not Allowed)        |
           | trace   | Error 405 (Method Not Allowed)        |
           | track   | Error 405 (Method Not Allowed)        |
  Scenario: Verify the 443 port is listening
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p 443 10.0.2.15
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      443/tcp\s+open
      """
    And the following profile:
      Scenario: perform few attacks on port
        When I launch a "sslyze" attack with:
          """
          sslyze --regular 10.0.2.15
          """
        Then the output should match:
          """
          vulnerable port
          """
